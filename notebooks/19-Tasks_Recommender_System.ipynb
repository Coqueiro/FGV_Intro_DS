    "There are three main classes of recommendation systems. Those are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Collaborative filtering systems – Collaborative systems generate recommendations based on crowd-sourced input. They recommend items based on user behavior, and similarities between users. (An example is Google PageRank, which recommends similar web pages based on a web pages’ back links)\n",
    "+ Content-based filtering systems – Content-based systems generate recommendations based on items and similarities between them. (Pandora uses content-based filtering to make its music recommendations)\n",
    "+ Hybrid recommendation systems – Hybrid recommendation systems combine both collaborative and content-based approaches. They help improve recommendations that are derived from sparse datasets. (Netflix is a prime example of a hybrid recommender)\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative systems often deploy a nearest neighbor method or a item-based collaborative filtering system – a simple system that makes recommendations based on simple regression or a weighted-sum approach. The end goal of collaborative systems is to make recommendations based on customers’ behavior, purchasing patterns, and preferences, as well as product attributes, price ranges, and product categories. Content-based systems can deploy methods as simple as averaging, or they can deploy advanced machine learning approaches in the form of Naive Bayes classifiers,  clustering algorithms or artificial neural nets."
